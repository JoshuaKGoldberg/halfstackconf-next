        <p className={styles.p}>
          HalfStack events are fun, creative single track JavaScript events
          hosted in relaxed environments. HalfStack provides authentic, high
          value experiences for all attendees.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.p}>
          The priority for HalfStack is the attendee experience, with great
          food, drinks, talks, swag, and community. Hosted by Londonâ€™s
          longest-lived JavaScript meetup group, HalfStack now extends beyond
          London to other cities including Vienna, Phoenix, Charlotte, Tel Aviv,
          Newquay, and New York. And online due to COVID.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.p}>
          HalfStack carefully curates talks that inspire and inform the audience
          in a highly interactive and entertaining manner. Each HalfStack event
          provides an intimate feeling where each attendee has time to meet one
          another.

        <p className={styles.p}>
          Due to COVID-19, all in-person indoor HalfStack events originally
          scheduled from March 2020 were postponed indefinitely and we&apos;re
          in the process of cautiously reopening.
          <p className={styles.p}></p>
          COVID-19 refund policy: Full refunds are available up to 7 days prior
          to a scheduled in-person event. If you choose to keep your HalfStack
          ticket until the rescheduled date, we will provide you with free
          access to our HalfStack Online events until we can safely have
          in-person events again.
